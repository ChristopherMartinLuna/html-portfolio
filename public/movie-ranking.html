<!--Movie #1-->
<h3>Star Wars - A New Hope</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/a_new_hope.jpg" width="400">
<p>The classic modern fairytale. A boy is called to adventure, leaves home, and is never the same.</p>
<!--Movie #2-->
<h3>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/indiana_jones.jpg" width="400">
<p>The search for the Holy Grail. A very old story, told again. This film is a masterpiece. 
    I wish they would have let Indiana Jones ride off in the sunset, and stay there. Instead we got the last
     two movies in the series. </p>
<!--Movie #3-->
<h3>Toy Story</h3>

<p>The first time I saw this Toy Story, it was a magical experience. Computer animation in film was
    a new idea for most viewers, including myself. I'd never seen anything like it. 
    In addition to being visually beautiful, the movie was filled with endearing characters,
    in a wonderful story, that I'll never forget.

<h3>Lady Bird</h3>

<p>This is a wonderful coming of age film. The movie reminds of living in Northern California before I moved to New York for college. 
    I lived in Stockton, California, and I took acting classes in Sacramento, and had a girlfriend there, while
    I was preparing to transfer to Columbia University. Watching this wonderfully crafted film brings all of those memories and
    emotions back to me. Sacramento is beautiful. It's easy to take that for granted.

<!--Movie #5-->
<h3>The Godfather 1</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/godfather.jpg" width="400">
<p>The first time I watched this movie, I was about 17 years old. I was in our family van, with my brothers and my best friend from high school.
The van was a red gladiator conversion van with a VCR and a 12 inch TV. My dad's friends used to 
call it the "Happy Roman". We took it on family trips, which we went on all the time. I think we were coming back from
Paso Robles. I remember my dad yelling at us to turn the sound up, becasue he couldn't hear it. We didn't 
even know he was listening because he was our chauffeur on these adventures.</p>

<p>Coming of age, the quest for power, the dynamics of family, getting life in order, the influence of Catholicism, I related to 
    this film in so many ways. My younger brother ended up naming his first dog Santino.</p>
    
<p>My dad passed over 20 years ago, but I assume the same must of really related to the story as well.
    I think he told me he read it while in the airforce. But he remembered telling the scene in the book 
    where the Don was in the hospital and Michael went outside with Enzo the baker. There was a planned
    hit on his father. Michael caught on, and pretended to be armed security with Enzo. After, enzo is shaking
    while trying to be light his cigarette. So much that he can't light it. Michael calmly lights it. 
    In that moment, he knew he knew something was different about himself.

<h3>The Godfather 2</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/godfather_2.jpg" width="400">
<p>Beautiful and tragic.</p>
<!--Movie #7-->
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/pulp_fiction.jpg" width="400">
<p>This movie is was so different than anything else I'd ever seen. The characters, dialogue, costumes,
    locations, structure. This is Quinton Tarantino at his best.</p>
<!--Movie #8-->
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/gladiator.jpg" width="400">
<p>Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?</p>
<!--Movie #9-->
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/forrest_gump.jpg" width="400">
<p>This movie is a magical movie, that is all american.</p>
<!-- Movie #10-->
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/lion_king.jpg" width="400">
<p>A more digestable version of Hamlet.</p>
<!--Movie #11-->
<h3>The Shape of Water</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/shape_of_water.jpg" width="400">
<p>After I was this movie my first thought was, "This is a masterpiece." My second thought was, "No one will watch this in 5 years - it's too weird for most Americans." In the movie, a woman falls in love with a fish. But the story is essentially a retelling of beauty and the beast. There are so many layers and detials. This film is an exmaple of a director at the peak of his craft.</p>
<!--Movie #12-->
<h3>No Country for Old Men</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/no_country_for_old_men.jpg" width="400">
<p>No words.</p>
<h3>Lost in translation</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/lost_in_translation.jpg" width="400">
<p>Lost in translation... aren't all relationships? </p>
<h3>American Beauty</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/american_beauty.jpg" width="400">
<p>I don't remember much about this movie, except I loved it when I saw it. It's probably time to 
    watch it again."</p>


<h3>A general reflection</h3>
<p>The movies I picked, are movies I felt connected to in some way. So maybe the say more about
    me than any other the films. In nearly all of them, the lead is male.
