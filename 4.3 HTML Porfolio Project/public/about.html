  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Christopher Luna. I’m 44 years old, and I’ve been an entrepreneur 
  for almost 20 years. I live in New York City with my puppy, Layla, a Labradoodle.

<p>I grew up in a tech family. My father worked in the semiconductor industry until 
  he passed away at 47. Growing up around technology, I was always interested in new
   innovations and tech businesses.</p>

<p>On a couple of occasions, I partnered with a software engineer to pursue a tech
   startup. However, I found software engineers to be incredibly unreliable partners.
    After those experiences, I promised myself I would never work on another startup
     where I couldn’t control the development of the product—either through funding
      or by knowing how to build the product myself.</p>
  
<p>When I look back at the things I’ve built, I feel proud. But I also have a deep
   interest in emerging technologies that I haven’t fully had the opportunity to explore
    professionally. Between the time I graduated high school in 1999 and now, there have
     been several technology waves I wasn’t in a position to capitalize on. I see another
      wave forming with artificial intelligence, and I want to position myself to catch
       it. So, for my birthday, I’ve decided to learn to code and see how far I can get
        over the next 12 months.</p>
